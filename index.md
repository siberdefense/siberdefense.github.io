**All MSHS students!**

Attendance is free and always open.

No experience required. Come willing to learn and consider enrolling
in one of the various Computer Science courses available at MSHS 
to supercharge your security skills.

Bring your laptop! Many exercises work with district-provided devices. But 
having your own device is helpful to experiment with new software tools. 
The club also provides devices for students to use during club meetings and events.

## What

**Solve hands on information security challenges.**

The club holds both weekly club meetings, 
as well as various off hours competition/events.
Attendance is always optional.

A typical meeting starts with a topic introduction and then students 
dive into a challenge with instructors there to help.

On and off hours cyber competitions, as teams and individuals events,
are held in-person and on-line, and tackle Cyber Security challenges.

We encourage students to work together and help each other.
