Are you a cyber security professional with a connection to the Snoqualmie Valley
School District? We want to hear from you! We create a positive learning
environment to introduce motivated high schoolers to our profession and we need
your help.

With all the awesome tech talent in and around the Snoqualmie Valley we're sure
there are others willing to get involved. We've all got day jobs and life
happens, so you don't have to make every session. Coaches work together so the
more help we have the better experience we can give to a wider variety of
students. All infosec disciplines and skill fields are welcome. Everyone in the
field has something valuable to add.

Get started by introducing yourself to the coaches at
[SiberDefenseClub@svsd410.org](mailto:SiberDefenseClub@svsd410.org). We'd love
to tell you what we're about and set you up for success as a co-instructor.
