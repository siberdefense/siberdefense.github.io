Are you a cyber security professional with a connection to Snoqualmie Valley? We want to hear from you! We create a positive learning environment to introduce motivated high schoolers to our profession and we need your help.

With all the awesome tech talent in and around the Snoqualmie Valley we're sure there are others willing to get involved. We've all got day jobs and life happens, so you don't have to make every session. Coaches work together so the more help we have the better experience we can give to a wider variety of students. All skill disciplines and skill fields are welcome. Everyone in the field has something valuable to add.

Get started by introducing yourself to the coaches at [SiberDefenseClub@svsd410.org](mailto:SiberDefenseClub@svsd410.org). We'd love to tell you what we're about and set you up for success as a co-instructor.
