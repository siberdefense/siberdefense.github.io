Hello, Mount Si High School students!

Are you fascinated by technology and interested in learning more about the world of cyber security? If so, we have the perfect opportunity for you! I'm excited to introduce you to the Siber Defense Club, a welcoming and inclusive club for students from 9th to 12th grade who want to delve into cyber security and build valuable skills for the future.

No prior experience is needed to join the club, making it the perfect place for students to begin their journey in cyber security. All you need is a willingness to learn basic programming and a desire to engage with like-minded peers. At the Siber Defense Club, we focus on collaboration, helping each other grow and improve our skills in a supportive environment.

Our club meets every Monday from 2:45PM to 4:00PM, and each meeting starts with a short topic introduction from one of our volunteer advisors. These experts are actively working in the field of cyber security and are eager to share their knowledge and experience with you. Following the introduction, students have the chance to work on hands-on challenges, putting their newfound knowledge into practice.

A laptop is necessary to participate in the club, but don't worry if you don't have one - the school-provided device should be sufficient for most situations. Additionally, we have a few extra laptops available for those in need.

As the year progresses, club members will learn the skills and topics required to compete in a series of international contests that present real-world cyber security problems. These competitions not only help to test and refine your skills, but also offer a fantastic opportunity to showcase your abilities and make connections in the cyber security community.

For more advanced students, we also provide opportunities to co-teach and assist in guiding the learning process. This is an excellent way to practice your communication and leadership skills while giving back to the club and helping fellow members succeed.

If you're ready to embark on a rewarding and exciting journey into cyber security, we invite you to join us at the next Siber Defense Club meeting. We can't wait to see you there and help you unlock your full potential!

Best regards,

[Your Name]
